# LogicVis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orenjina/LogicVis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orenjina/LogicVis)

See user manual here:
[User Manual](/User%20Manual.pdf)

For initial results, do any of the following:
1. To see the results from our script, run the following command in the terminal at the root directory: ./scripts/initial_results.sh

The program will first build and test, listing out its test results.

Then, you should be able to see string representation print out of a tree in the terminal (See [testCode](/src/main/resources/testCode.java) for the original code of the tree). 

In addition, there will be a pop-up that represents the basic representation of the UI we plan to make. This UI is not functional yet.

2. Directly check the scripts in the scripts folder and run each command independently.
