Plans from last week:
    - work on finding out how to parse out the recursion method call and make an enum type for it

Progress made this week:
    - made changes to my code according to Andrew's need
    - sat down in meetings with the implementation group to talk about one specific technical
    difficulties regarding to the recursion recognition and tracking
    - resolved the difficulty on my end by digging into the api more and try out different ways of
    implementation

Plans for next week:
    - write java doc tomorrow and polish the project
