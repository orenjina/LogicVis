Goals last week:
1. Look into parsing tools (IMPLEM)
2. Decide on how to do variable tracking (IMPLEM)
3. Weekly report and TA meeting agenda (EVAL)
4. User studies (EVAL)

Progress this week:

Goals for the next week:
1. Continue to add user studies to support the claim if necessary (EVAL)
2. Compare different UI options and research their effectiveness if necessary (EVAL)
3. Implement the parsing tool hopefully from the JavaParser API (IMPLEM)
