Goals from last week:
    - work on parsing special cases (if/else, loops, etc.)
    - work on potentially implementing our own tree structure or using the API one to build graph

Progress made this week:
    - implemented our own tree class
    - started working on building the tree from source code (finished if, for loop, and return)

Plans for next week:
    - work on more types of statement parsing
    - work on taking a string rather than a file
