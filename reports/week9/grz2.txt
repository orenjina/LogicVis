Last Week's Goals
------------------
 - Do further user testing according to the feedback that will be given this week (Rolled over: no working UI to do this yet)
 - Successfully set up the testing for the project and write tests
 - Set up the data analysis pipeline
 - Put in sufficient materials to indicate how to generate data
 - Draft the final report

Progress
---------
 - Performed peer review
 - Set up testing for the project
 - Found out that setting up data analysis pipeline is unnecessary in this case, so we will not be doing that (similar case about data generation)
 - Figured out the structure of the final report
 - Edited report to fix mistake according to the feedbacks from last week
 - Altered user studies according to the limitations of our current implementation
 - Conducted user studies and obtained results on 3 users

This Week's Goals
------------------
 - Finish drafting the final report
 - Perform more user studies based on a newer version of the product, which does not yet have a definite date of completion
 - Help complete the UI and GUI aspects of the project if it is necessary
 - Expand more on the final report based on the progress that will be made in the following week
