Goals from last week:
    - work on more types of statement parsing
    - work on taking a string rather than a file

Progress made this week:
    - implemented while loop handler
    - front end reported that it needs a parseFirst function since we don't know the function name
    so worked on implementing that
    - added more comments
    - completed the presentation
    - submitted pull requests for code review

Plans for next week:
    - work on finding out how to parse out the recursion method call and make an enum type for it
